Certainly. Below are two clean, polished narrative pitches for IBIT accumulation (ASR-style) and disposal (reverse ASR-style) strategies, each written as a professional, client-facing summary without bullet points. These can be used in conversations, written communications, or slide decks — they include macro context, structural detail, and the rationale for embedding a ceiling or floor, all within the preferred 3–9 month tenor and your bank’s assumption of slippage risk.

IBIT Accumulation Program (ASR-style)

The current macroeconomic environment is increasingly supportive of long-duration, non-sovereign assets. With the Fed expected to begin cutting rates as early as September, and forward markets already pricing a full easing cycle through mid-2026, the setup favors asset classes that respond positively to falling real rates and expanding liquidity conditions. Bitcoin, which historically leads broader risk assets around policy inflection points, stands to benefit from this directional shift. At the same time, the post-halving cycle — now entering its seasonally strongest phase — reinforces the structural tailwind behind digital asset flows.

IBIT, as the most liquid and institutionally accepted Bitcoin ETF, provides an efficient vehicle for building exposure. For allocators seeking to scale into a position without materially impacting price, a structured accumulation program offers an attractive solution. The strategy involves the bank purchasing IBIT over a defined period — typically between three and nine months — and delivering the position at the end of the program against a pre-agreed benchmark, usually volume-weighted average price (VWAP). Importantly, the bank assumes the slippage and execution risk throughout, allowing the client to maintain predictable pricing and clean benchmark alignment.

To protect against unfavorable timing into market rallies or momentum-driven surges, an embedded ceiling can be introduced. This ceiling acts as a predefined upper limit on execution levels relative to the initial reference price, mitigating the risk of accumulating IBIT into a breakout. Should market prices exceed this threshold during the program, execution can be slowed or paused, preserving price discipline and avoiding entry into extended technical moves. The result is a program that enables efficient, risk-managed exposure to IBIT, well-aligned with macro conditions and executed with minimal footprint.

IBIT Disposal Program (Reverse ASR-style)

Bitcoin has experienced significant appreciation since early 2024, supported by structural inflows from U.S. spot ETFs, favorable supply dynamics post-halving, and broader optimism around digital asset legitimacy. IBIT, in particular, has become the primary institutional vehicle for accessing Bitcoin exposure. However, with a substantial portion of the macro narrative already priced in — particularly the anticipated Fed policy pivot — some holders may now look to rebalance, reduce exposure, or monetize gains ahead of potential inflection points in market sentiment.

A reverse ASR-style disposal program offers a disciplined, low-impact framework for exiting a position over time. Under this structure, the bank unwinds the position on behalf of the client across a defined horizon — typically three to nine months — and delivers the final execution price based on a VWAP benchmark. All slippage and execution risk are absorbed by the bank, ensuring orderly disposal with minimal exposure to adverse market impact or signaling.

In periods of elevated volatility or market fragility, the risk of price drawdowns can become material. To mitigate the potential for forced selling into weak markets, the program can include an embedded floor — a minimum execution level set relative to the initial reference price. If IBIT trades below this threshold during the program, execution may pause or adjust, preserving the integrity of exit pricing. This mechanism provides downside protection while allowing for passive, rules-based execution through varying liquidity environments.

The reverse ASR structure is particularly well suited for institutions managing substantial IBIT positions who seek to unwind exposure gradually, without telegraphing intent or compromising price efficiency. It is a strategic way to monetize gains, reduce beta, or rotate capital in anticipation of changing macro or asset-specific dynamics — all while maintaining control over execution thresholds and timeline.
